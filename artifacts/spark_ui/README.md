Add screenshots after running jobs:
- `ingest_jobs.png`
- `pipeline_broadcast_join.png`
- `ml_cv_stages.png`
- `scaling_comparison.png`

Capture recommended tabs:
- SQL -> physical plan (broadcast hash join evidence)
- Stages -> task time, spill, shuffle read/write
- Jobs -> total runtime comparison before/after optimization
